## Lyrics

```

0:54

feign on, reign's up 
all the things you sought 
so vicious still not playing wise, 
seers have many eyes on truth
and that's why (?) feeling trapped in retinas   ///// (they - rhyme with feign and game)
(sharp circles) caught in (upward) whites
traced to the backheads of the crowd 
scent is on us, that's my (their) game

blink twice if you understand  
phase still rages(ing) way too fast 
so many ways to comprehend
let's all close our eyes
returning to neverending black

turn to naught for the better,
be(ing) good, bellow tell the truth
about what you're not
accepting for the world's views

it turns out all demons were outside
when all time i spent was thinking it's me
the sadness it opened old wounds were alight
and sliced them again

i spilled all my dreams into form of delight
emotions from hatred caught fire
all reason burned down

tell me what that about 
i really wanna know 

now we really get to talk 
what makes you (all) mad 

quit throwin' (these) sighs, 
feeling downed is
what stops you cold 

what makes you draw
blank faces wrong
doing nothing worth
while coaching all
not to drop and fall

kneeling down to other's

thoughts like damn 
that (what) makes us low (go)

little bit of facts
all it took was bites



riding (in) vicious tracks, feeling inside out
just get it out 
i'll do what's needs done
i'm an honest man
maybe just to honest
to make you feel at home

so shout to me and make it count
get it out i'll do what gets you done
i'm an honest man, maybe just too honest
to make you feel at home



making choices run, 








```
